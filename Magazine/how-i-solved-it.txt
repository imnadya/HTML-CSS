Use the minmax function to make your columns responsive on any device. 
The minmax function takes two arguments, the first being the minimum value and the second being the maximum. 
These values could be a length, percentage, fr, or even a keyword like max-content.
Wrap each of your already defined values of the grid-template-columns property in a minmax function, using each value as the second argument. 
The first argument should be 2rem, min-content, and 2rem respectively.
main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(2rem, 1fr) minmax(min-content, 94rem) minmax(2rem, 1fr);
}

To add space between rows in the grid layout, I used the row-gap property. 
Give the main selector a row-gap property of 3rem.
row-gap: 3rem;

Magazine will have three primary sections. 
I already set the overall layout in the main rule, but I can adjust the placement in the child rules.
One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. 
The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.
Create a .heading rule and set the grid-column property to 2 / 3. 
This will tell the .heading element to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3.
.heading {
  grid-column: 2/3;
}

Create a .text selector and give it a grid-column property set to 2 / 3.
.text {
  grid-column: 2/3;
}
